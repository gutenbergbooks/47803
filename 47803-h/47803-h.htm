<div class="i1"><i>You led me hillward. With the clouds</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>We two were driven and the gales</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>That filled your soul's delightful sails</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Shook my faint spirit's shrouds.</i></div><br />

<div class="i0"><i>There where the &aelig;ons still emboss</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Cromlech and cairn and tufa crown</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>With lichen cold and stag-horn moss</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>And callous suns cross and recross,</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>You paused, and I looked down</i></div><br />

<div class="i0"><i>And saw the straight strait Roman road,</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>The entangling lanes, our wayward track</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>And vestiges of all who strode</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>On the old quest with the old load</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Beckoned me back and back.</i></div><br />

<div class="i0"><i>Sweet wood-smoke climbing up the fell</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Met me half-way as down I won,</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>And met me too the climbing bell</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>That bids the world kneel to a knell,</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>A knell ascending to the sun.</i></div><br />

<div class="i0"><i>The holy bell shall tune my note,</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>The stars shall touch my thatch at night,</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Within my spirit's dark stream shall float</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>A planet, meek as a child's boat,</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>That mocked your utmost height.</i></div><br />

<div class="i0"><i>Yet I am yours&mdash;your pace is stamped</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>On mine, o'er mine your spirit broods&mdash;</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Who tread the sanctuary hushed and lamped</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>With strides that took the heath and tramped</i></div>
<div class="i1"><i>Your hopeless altitudes.</i></div><br />

<div class="i0">Unwisely out of season. With the rest</div>

<h2>SIR BAT-EARS</h2>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="i0 fletter">SIR BAT-EARS was a dog of birth</div>
<div class="i1">And bred in Aberdeen,</div>
<div class="i0">But he favoured not his noble kin</div>
<div class="i1">And so his lot is mean,</div>
<div class="i0">And Sir Bat-ears sits by the alms-houses</div>
<div class="i1">On the stones with grass between.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">Under the ancient archway</div>
<div class="i1">His pleasure is to wait</div>
<div class="i0">Between the two stone pine-apples</div>
<div class="i1">That flank the weathered gate;</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">And old, old alms-persons go by,</div>
<div class="i1">All rusty, bent and black</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<div class="i0">"Good day, good day, Sir Bat-ears!"</div>
<div class="i1">They say and stroke his back.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">And old, old alms-persons go by,</div>
<div class="i1">Shaking and wellnigh dead,</div>
<div class="i0">"Good night, good night, Sir Bat-ears!"</div>
<div class="i1">They say and pat his head.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">So courted and considered</div>
<div class="i1">He sits out hour by hour,</div>
<div class="i0">Benignant in the sunshine</div>
<div class="i1">And prudent in the shower.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">(Nay, stoutly can he stand a storm</div>
<div class="i1">And stiffly breast the rain,</div>
<div class="i0">That rising when the cloud is gone</div>
<div class="i1">He leaves a circle of dry stone</div>
<div class="i0">Whereon to sit again.)</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">A dozen little door-steps</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<div class="i0">Under the arch are seen,</div>
<div class="i0">A dozen ag&egrave;d alms-persons</div>
<div class="i1">To keep them bright and clean;</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">Two wrinkled hands to scour each step</div>
<div class="i1">With a square of yellow stone&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">But print-marks of Sir Bat-ears' paws</div>
<div class="i1">Bespeckle every one.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">And little eats an alms-person,</div>
<div class="i1">But, though his board be bare,</div>
<div class="i0">There never lacks a bone of the best</div>
<div class="i1">To be Sir Bats-ears' share.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">Mendicant muzzle and shrewd nose,</div>
<div class="i1">He quests from door to door;</div>
<div class="i0">Their grace they say, his shadow grey</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<div class="i1">Is instant on the floor&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">Humblest of all the dogs there be,</div>

<div class="i0">Only the lashes of her eyes</div>
<div class="i1">Some ancient discontent impairs,</div>

<div class="i0">Only their fring&egrave;d towels veil</div>
<div class="i1">The fender's interwoven wire,</div>

<div class="i0">The High Street clambers, looking down</div>
<div class="i1">On willows, weirs and water-lilies;</div>
<div class="i0">What goblin homes those gradients bear,</div>
<div class="i1">Doors that for all their new defacements</div>

<div class="i0">Simkin, the urchin with the shock</div>
<div class="i1">Of curls rush-hatted, plainly preaches</div>
<div class="i0">The Age of Reason in a smock</div>
<div class="i1">And Liberty in holland breeches,</div>
<div class="i0">Yet all obediently he'll ramp</div>
<div class="i1">Against the counter, pressing closer</div>
<div class="i0">To watch you lick a ha'penny stamp</div>
<div class="i1">Or see you settle with the grocer.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">But once your steps retrace the town</div>
<div class="i1">And "Home's" the goal your folly mentions</div>
<div class="i0">A thousand projects of his own</div>
<div class="i1">Engage the sum of his attentions&mdash;</div>

<div class="i1">He mounts with two-year-old activity</div>
<div class="i0">The great stone horse-block by the kerb</div>
<div class="i1">Time-worn to glacial declivity.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">Then debonair and undebarred</div>
<div class="i1">By the old hound, its casual sentry,</div>
<div class="i0">He dallies in "The Old George" yard</div>
<div class="i1">And greets the jackdaw in the entry;</div>
<div class="i0">Retracted to the street, he gains</div>
<div class="i1">A sombre door no sunshine mellows,</div>
<div class="i0">The smithy, where there glows and wanes</div>
<div class="i1">Fire, at the bidding of the bellows.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">A-tip-toe at the infrequent shops</div>
<div class="i1">Toys or tin kettles he appraises,</div>
<div class="i0">Seeds in bright packets, lollipops,</div>
<div class="i1">Through the dim oriels' greenish glazes:</div>
<div class="i0">Then with two sturdy hands he shakes</div>

<div class="i1">The stripling sycamore that dapples</div>
<div class="i0">With shade the side-walk and awakes</div>
<div class="i1">Some ancient memory of apples.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">Next he rejoins, beneath a sky</div>
<div class="i1">With willow-leaves and gnats a-quiver,</div>
<div class="i0">The dapper martins where they ply</div>
<div class="i1">A clayey traffic by the river;</div>
<div class="i0">Watches the minnows in the warm</div>
<div class="i1">Near shallows with a smile persuading&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">He could not come to any harm</div>
<div class="i1">On such a heaven-sent day for wading!</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">Home's gained at last. At last they cease,</div>
<div class="i1">Coaxes, entreaties, threats, coercions;</div>
<div class="i0">An old gate's iron fleurs-de-lis</div>
<div class="i1">Shut upon Simkin's last diversions.</div>
<div class="i0">The garden crossed, the door stands wide,</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>

<div class="i0">But passive as a Roman bride,</div>

<div class="i0 fletter">THE pigeons dwell in Pimlico; they mingle in the street;</div>
<div class="i0">They flutter at Victoria around the horses' feet;</div>
<div class="i0">They fly to meet the royal trains with many a loyal phrase</div>

<div class="i0"><i>But Peter, Peter Pigeon, salutes his cradle days.</i></div>

<div class="i0">The pigeons build in Bloomsbury; they rear their classic homes</div>

<div class="i0">They haunt Ionic capitals with learned lullabies</div>

<div class="i0"><i>But Peter, Peter Pigeon, how sleepily he sighs!</i></div>
<br />
<div class="i0">The pigeons walk the Guildhall; they dress in civic taste</div>
<div class="i0">With amplitude of mayoral chain and aldermanic waist;</div>
<div class="i0">They bow their grey emphatic heads, their topknots rise and fall,</div>
<div class="i0">They cluster in the courtyard at their midday dinner call;</div>
<div class="i0"><i>But Peter, Peter Pigeon, he nods beneath my shawl</i>.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">The pigeons brood in Battersea; while yet the dawn is dark</div>
<div class="i0">Their ready aubade ripples in the plane-trees round the park;</div>

<div class="i0">They light upon your balcony, a brave and comely band,</div>

<p>RHYMES OF A HENWIFE. By <span class="smcap">Margaret Lavington</span>.<br />
With numerous Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Helen Urquhart</span>.<br />
Crown 8vo. 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</p>

<p>If Ann and Jane Taylor had lived in the twentieth century
and taken to keeping poultry for profit in war time, they
would probably have had a laudable desire to inculcate the
principles and practice of hen-keeping among the young. But
unless they had developed an unexpected sense of humour
they wouldn't have produced anything like "Cackles and
Lays," for while some of Margaret Lavington's rhymes are
practical and sprightly, others are just delightfully whimsical
and humorous.</p>

<p>An unconventional book for children in that it is illustrated

of the kind that will appeal to all children and all grown-ups
who love children.</p>
